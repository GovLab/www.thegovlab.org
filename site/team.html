                        <h3>Anirudh Dinesh</h3>
                        <h4>Research/Tech Associate Fellow</h4>

                        <p>Anirudh Dinesh conducts research on governance innovation. He is a member of the team designing and piloting <a href="http://smartercrowdsourcing.org">experiments</a> for <a href="http://www.thegovlab.org/project-civic-challenges-san-pedro-garza-garcia.html">new models</a> of public engagement, what the GovLab calls people-led innovation, to improve the legitimacy and effectiveness of <a href="https://crowd.law">policy making</a> and solve urgent problems.</p>
<p>In addition, Anirudh is a member of the Data Labs research team looking at how governments can create the infrastructure, including the necessary skills and governance rules, to facilitate the use of administrative data for evaluating and improving public programs. With a grant from Markets for Good, he is collaborating with <a href="http://thinknpc.org">New Philanthropy Capital</a> in the UK to craft a series of <a href="https://medium.com/data-labs">case studies about Data Labs</a> and explore how they can enable charities as well as government to conduct more data-driven impact evaluations.</p>
<p>Last year, Anirudh helped to research, write and produce ten original <a href="http://www.smarterstate.org">Smarter State</a> case studies, focusing on how governments can use technology to leverage the skills of civil servants. He has also researched and authored reports on <a href="http://odimpact.org">Open Data for Developing Economies</a>, a project to explore the social and economic impact of opening government data.</p>
<p>In his job, Anirudh organizes events at the GovLab. He was part of the organizing team of the <a href="http://collectiveintelligenceconference.org">Collective Intelligence Conference</a> (June 2017). He has coordinated multiple online classes and coaching programs for the GovLab Academy, including the ones on <a href="http://govlabacademy.org/innovations-in-tech-enabled-disaster-management-detail.html">innovations in tech-enabled disaster management</a> and <a href="http://govlabacademy.org/coaching-program-for-data-driven-criminal-justice-projects-detail.html">data driven criminal justice</a>.</p>
<p>Whether in connection with events or research projects, Anirudh applies his background in computer science to help create high impact websites. He is a part of GovLab’s civic tech efforts and assists in the design and development of all of GovLab’s original tools and platforms.</p>
<p>Prior to joining GovLab, Anirudh co-produced <a href="https://www.ted.com/tedx/events/14384">TEDxBNMIT 2015</a>, an independently organized TEDx event in Bangalore, India.</p>
<p>Anirudh holds a master’s degree in Computer Engineering from New York University and an undergraduate degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from the Visvesvaraya Technological University in India. While studying there, he interned at the Defence Research and Development Organization, where he implemented the autonomous indoor navigation of a quadcopter.</p>
<p>Anirudh is an avid blogger and his writings can be found at <a href="http://www.dudurudh.com">www.dudurudh.com</a>.</p>

                        <h4>GRADUATE RESEARCH FELLOW</h4>

                        <p>Gabriella (Gabby) researches, designs, and advocates for public participation in lawmaking (“crowdlaw”). She is pursuing a JD/MBA at the Yale Law School and Yale School of Management. Her work includes completing a global survey of legislative initiatives that use crowdlaw to improve the effectiveness of legislative procedure and outcomes. She is also tracking public engagement legislation and collaborating with researchers at Harvard University to develop a model legal framework for institutionalizing public engagement. She believes that crowdlaw can help communities to make more informed, effective, and democratic decisions.</p> <p>Previously, Gabby was a Project Manager at Locus Analytics/Syntax Funds, a data analytics and investment management firm, where she built data organization structures for risk stratification in portfolio management and community development. She also has experience in intellectual property strategy, fleet management technology, as well as in the Colombian public and nonprofit sectors. A graduate of Swarthmore College, she studied political science, Latin American studies, and spatial analytics for public policy. Gabby is fluent in Spanish.

                        <h4>Senior Fellow</h4>

                        <p>Gianpaolo Baiocchi is a senior fellow at the GovLab. He is sociologist and an ethnographer interested in questions of politics and culture, critical social theory, and cities. He has written about and continues to research instances of actually existing civic life and participatory democracy. Gianpaolo is associate professor of individualized studies and sociology at NYU, where he directs the Gallatin School’s Urban Democracy Lab, which promotes radically democratic praxis and reflection, and is an important reference in New York City’s Left. Gianpaolo is recognized as one of the leading experts on participatory budgeting, and participatory democracy more generally, a topic he has researched and written extensively about both in the context of his native Brazil but also in terms of its global travel. He continues to research the intersection of left-wing party politics and radical democracy, often directly engaged with, and learning from Brazil’s Workers’ Party. His books on Porto Alegre’s administration under the PT, and on the first PT administrations in Brazil are international references. His last book, with Ernesto Ganuza, is called Popular Democracy and the Paradox of Participation, and some of his political commentary can be found in Boston Review.

                        <p>Research Fellow María Hermosilla focuses her work on governance innovation in Latin America. At the GovLab, she does both research and project design and management. She conducts research on how technology is transforming government, which includes work on the impact of innovations such as big and open data, crowdsourcing, people analytics, and public labs on executive and legislative institutions. She is a collaborator on the <a href="http://www.thegovlab.org/smarterstate.html">Smarter State case studies series</a>, which focuses on how public institutions use new technology to accelerate learning, and she does ongoing work on mapping the skills and expertise gap in government.</p> <p>Complementing her research, María has convened and moderated a GovLab online conference on <a href="http://www.thegovlab.org/project-crowdlaw.html">CrowdLaw</a> that brought together practitioners working on participatory lawmaking from 16 countries. She is also collaborating on efforts to convene another global online conference series on using technology and innovation to combat mosquito borne illness.</p> <p>Her projects include working with GovLab’s engineering team on the design and implementation of <a href="https://networkofinnovators.org/">Network of Innovators</a>, the bilingual skill-sharing network for government and civic innovators worldwide. In that capacity, she works with public sector partners to promote use of such platforms to accelerate learning, including organizing workshops and training in Mexico and the UK.</p> <p>An experienced facilitator and trainer, María has designed and led the GovLab’s coaching program for the Organization of American States Open Government Fellows, working with government officials and nonprofit leaders across the Americas to help them take public interest projects from idea to implementation. She also helped lead the GovLab’s online lab design coaching program and collaborated in curriculum design and implementation of a GovLab-United States Department of Agriculture open data summer camp.</p> <p>Prior to the Govlab, María worked in national government in Chile, leading the redesign of citizen information services and open data efforts at the Ministry of Public Works. She also designed public consultations and led the digitalization of services. Before going into the public sector, María worked in television as a producer, reporter and assistant director and served as a freelance correspondent for NPR.</p> <p>A native Spanish speaker, María has a Master of Public Administration at New York University, where she studied public and nonprofit management with an emphasis on design thinking, data science and participatory policymaking.</p> <p>Her writings can be found on the <a href="http://thegovlab.org/author/maria-hermosilla/">GovLab’s blog</a> and on <a href="http://www.governing.com/authors/Maria-Hermosilla.html">Governing</a>.

                        <p>Victoria Alsina is a Senior Fellow at the GovLab and Faculty Associate at the Mossavar-Rahmani Center for Business & Government at the Harvard Kennedy School.</p>
<p>Her current research focuses on finding innovative solutions to regenerate the public sector, helping communities and institutions to work together to solve problems more effectively and legitimately. Likewise, she explores how collaborative governance can change the way we govern solving some of society's most pressing problems at the intersection of the public and private sectors, developing innovative and practical policy solutions for cities.</p>
<p>Currently, she collaborates on GovLab Academy projects focused on promoting effective public engagement in lawmaking (CrowdLaw) and training civic leaders and civil servants in how to collaborate with their own communities (Civic Challenges). She has been also part of the Coaching Program Initiative, developing and scaling innovative projects, from idea to implementation.</p>
<p>At Harvard, she is Chair of the Study Group “The Challenge to Design a Technological Agora” and she leads the projects “Creating new conceptual and analytical frameworks to study public-private collaboration in Southern Europe and Latin America” and “Discovering who transforms Barcelona: Redefining public and private roles in urban transformation. Collaboration models and community impact.” As a member of the Transparency Policy Project at the Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation, she contributes research for a new project on empowering patients through data and technology.</p>
<p>She is also Senior Researcher for the European Union Erasmus + Jean Monnet Project “Enhancing governance of EU policies: legal and institutional learnings from a US-EU dialogue.” Likewise, she advises numerous public and private institutions, including the OECD, the European Union and the Inter-American Development Bank, and trains civic leaders and civil servants on issues related to public sector reform, public-private collaboration, collaborative governance and democratic regeneration through technology.</p>
<p>She holds a BA in Political and Administration Sciences from Pompeu Fabra University, an MPA from the Autonomous University of Barcelona, an MA in Public Management from ESADE Business School, and a PhD in Political and Social Sciences from Pompeu Fabra University.
