                <p><b>Closing Date:</b> Open until filled.</p>

                <p><b>Location:</b> While the majority of the GovLab’s staff is based in Brooklyn (NYC), we strive to be a global organization with team members located all over the world.</p>

                <p>The Governance Lab (the GovLab) is excited to announce the search for a talented Director of Communications. The Governance Lab is a research, training and experimentation laboratory, based at NYU Tandon School of Engineering, that focuses on improving people’s lives by addressing real world challenges through institutional redesign.</p>

S/he will employ a wide range of tools and tactics to ensure information reaches target audiences with measurable impact.</p>
                <p>The GovLab not only seeks to be a leader and innovator in how to conduct action-research, it also wants to innovate how to communicate effectively and meaningfully.

                <p><b>Job Description:</b></p>
                <p>Reporting directly to Senior GovLab leadership, the Director of Communications is expected to become the GovLab’s key ambassador, building strong relationships with intermediaries, including the media, and major stakeholders and will be tasked in developing and implementing a communications strategy for the GovLab’s data program including projects such as <a href="http://datacollaboratives.org/">Data Collaboratives</a>, <a href="http://odimpact.org/">Open Data’s Impact</a>, <a href="http://www.thegovlab.org/project-open-data-for-developing-economies.html">Open Data for Developing Economies</a> and <a href="http://www.opendata500.com/">Open Data 500</a>.</p>
                <p>The Director of Communications will enhance the GovLab’s social media presence, developing content for website(s), initiating a targeted audience strategy, and managing a fully integrated dissemination plan for various projects of GovLab’s data program that includes speaking engagements, onsite and offsite events, leveraging networks and fundraising when needed.</p>
