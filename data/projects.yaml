    <p>In response, the Governance Lab and the Inter-American Development Bank in partnership with the Governments of the City of Rio de Janeiro, Argentina, Colombia and Panama, hosted a series of online conferences from August-October 2016. Instead of a handful of people meeting once at great expense in a conference room, we used the Internet to mobilize and curate diverse and distributed expertise -- both credentialed know-how and experiential wisdom -- to identify, design and iterate upon implementable ideas that governments can use. Conference topics included:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Assessing Public Awareness </li>
    <li>Communication and Behavior Change </li>
    <li>Trash and Standing Water </li>
    <li>Information Collection/Data Governance </li>
    <li>Long Term Care </li>
    <li>Predictive Analytics </li>
    </ol>
  background: >
    <p>Global and complex public health emergencies, such as Zika, Dengue and Chikungunya, threaten public health and well-being, risk disruption to global and regional trade and economic stability, and cause widespread uncertainty and concern. They are complex and interdependent problems that demand access to expertise that is diverse and widely dispersed. But mobilizing this expertise -- both credentialed know-how and experiential wisdom-- demands coordination and curation to bring the best thinking to bear and translate good ideas into actionable proposals backed by evidence.</p>

    <p>The Smarter Crowdsourcing team conducted a series of interviews and research into the ideas that were generated during the conferences, identifying their costs and benefits, the steps required for implementation, and the key strategic decisions that governments would need to make along the way. The team’s findings were combined into an Implementation Report, which consists of twenty initiatives selected for their importance and potential impact as well as their suitability for immediate implementation. The Implementation Report is designed to enable public authorities to translate these new ideas into practical improvements in the way they deliver policies and services. </p>

  problem_statement: Worked with the Mexican government, civil society and over 100 global experts in the summer of 2017 to devise solutions to the problem of corruption in Mexico. #question
  short_description:
  tooltip:
  long_description: >
    <p><a href="http://www.thegovlab.org/">The GovLab</a>, in partnership with the <a href="http://www.iadb.org/">Inter-American Development Bank (IDB)</a> and Mexico’s <a href="http://www.gob.mx/sfp">Secretariat of the Civil Service</a> (Secretaría de la Función Pública, or SFP), held a series of online conferences to generate new, actionable ideas in the fight against corruption in Mexico.</p>
    <p>Using The GovLab’s <a href="http://thegovlab.org/smarter-crowdsourcing-against-corruption/">Smarter Crowdsourcing</a> method, a collaborative problem-solving technique pairing the agility and diversity of crowdsourcing with the curation of relevant know-how in a format designed to produce effective and implementable outcomes, the series brought together over 100 <a href="http://anticorruption.smartercrowdsourcing.org/map.html">global experts</a> from 25 different countries with representatives from the Mexican government and civil society leaders.  These stakeholders and specialists convened virtually to share insights and identify innovative yet practical strategies capable of achieving measurable progress against corruption in six separate challenge areas:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Measuring Corruption and Its Costs</li>
    <li>Fostering Openness and Integrity in the Judiciary</li>
    <li>Facilitating Citizen Participation in Policymaking</li>
    <li>Ensuring Whistleblower Support and Protection</li>
    <li>Increasing the Effectiveness of Prosecution</li>
    <li>Tracking and Analyzing Money Flows</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These six areas were delineated following a rigorous research and evaluation process carried out by the Governance Innovation Clinic at the Yale Law School, created and led by The GovLab’s Director Professor Beth Simone Noveck. Graduate students in the Clinic, along with GovLab Research Fellows, conducted interviews and documented each issue extensively in an effort to define the problem of corruption by its root causes. In turn, the briefs they developed would anchor a specialized online session to focus the invited experts on identifying workable solutions in the form of new policies and services.</p>
  background: >
    <p>One in every three times a Mexican citizen interacts with government a bribe is paid (read more <a href="http://www.beta.inegi.org.mx/proyectos/enchogares/regulares/encig/2015/">here</a> or <a href="https://www.tm.org.mx/indice-nacional-de-corrupcion-y-buen-gobierno-incbg/">here</a>). The real cost of such a problem goes beyond the billions of diverted taxpayer pesos. It also hinders the delivery of essential government services, harms public safety, and reduces public trust in government. In a recent survey, corruption was named as the second most relevant problem in Mexico behind only crime and ahead of unemployment.</p>
    <p>In 2016, the challenge of corruption spurred an unprecedented legal reform process, driven by civil society. The passage of the National Anti-Corruption System calls for reforms across the federal government. The new legal framework –which has been <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/themexicoinstitute/2016/07/18/mexico-wins-anti-corruption-reform-approved/#40be4e83618b">widely heralded</a>– creates, for example, a specialized court on corruption crimes and it expands and improves the ethics obligations of public servants. Although the Sistema Nacional Anticorrupción (National Anti-Corruption System) has propelled Mexico to global leadership in the reach and strength of its anti-corruption laws, most of the battle still lies ahead, as government agencies, the judiciary, and civil society put this law into practice.

    <p>Toward that end, we are landscaping the current field of research investigating the value of open data in low and middle income contexts and developing a collection of  in-depth, illustrative and detailed case studies to better understand how developing countries are responding to public demand to open their data, who is making use of that data and for what, and what impact it is having in several key domains.</p>

  background: >
    <p>Recent years have witnessed considerable speculation about the potential of open data to bring about wide-scale transformation. The bulk of existing evidence about the impact of open data, however, focuses on high-income countries. Much less is known about open data’s role and value in low- and middle-income countries, and more generally about its possible contributions to economic and social development. The field lacks a coherent Theory of Change for how and in what contexts open data supports or hampers development.</p>

A user can load data like New York City’s deeds and mortgages directly into a powerful SQL database in just minutes instead of hours.</p>
    <p>Users no longer have to worry about schemas, transformations, load processes, or waiting for slow data portals.  Data from many formats is standardized and ready to go, fast. Installation is a snap: users don’t even need a SQL database installed beforehand. Docker for Data can be installed with <a href="https://github.com/talos/docker4data#try-it-out" target="_blank">one line of code</a>.</p>
  background: >
    <p>Existing open data portals are focused on views of single data sets in the browser. This is great until you need to do deep analysis or build a business on it.</p>
    <p>Downloading big datasets can take hours. It can take many more hours finding the location of important small datasets, especially those not living on the same portal. Add in a few more hours to load everything into a real database and figure out the relations, and you've spent days (or thousands of dollars) on something trivial. </p>
    <p>It doesn’t have to be this hard.</p>

    <p>OGRX is a platform for browsing and sharing research findings about new, innovative ways to solve public problems. It seeks to curate and make accessible a diversity of findings on innovating governance.</p>
    <p>Developed by the GovLab in collaboration with founding partners the World Bank Digital Engagement Evaluation Team and mySociety, OGRX provides:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A platform for researchers to share findings and methodologies;</li>
      <li>A repository of theoretical and applied research on open and innovative governance techniques and tools;</li>
      <li>A diversity of publication types – from research reports and journal articles to books and dissertations;</li>
      <li>A taxonomy for browsing research by type of innovation, objective, region, sector or tool;</li>
      <li>The ability to submit new research for inclusion on the site; and</li>
      <li>A community for those interested and committed to studying the impact of governance innovations and a place for those with research questions to connect to those with projects to study.</li>
    </ul>
  background: >
    <p>From crowdsourcing to nudges to open data to participatory budgeting, more open and innovative ways to tackle society's problems and make public institutions more effective are emerging. Yet little is known about what innovations actually work, when, why, for whom and under what conditions. Anyone seeking existing research relating to open data is confronted with sources that are widely dispersed across disciplines, often locked behind pay walls, and hard to search because of the absence of established taxonomies. As the demand to confront problems in new ways grows, so too does the urgency for making learning about governance innovations more accessible.</p>

  background: >
    <p>As public problems grow in complexity and increasingly require new insights, decision-makers both inside and outside government have begun exploring ways to be more data-driven and collaborative. Several of society’s greatest challenges—from addressing climate change to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals—require greater access to data, ability to analyze particular kinds of datasets, and collaboration between public- and private-sector entities. However, much of the most useful, timely and comprehensive data resides with the private sector—in the form of, for instance, Web clicks, online purchases, market research, sensor data, and data generated from the use of mobile phones. If we truly want to leverage the potential of data to improve people’s lives, then we need to accelerate the creation and use of “data collaboratives” in which participants from different sectors — including private companies, research institutions, and government agencies — can exchange data to help solve public problems.</p>

    <p>The 18-month initiative being comprises a number of activities aimed at increasing insight on current data collaboratives practice, what works and what doesn’t, how to share data in a trusted manner using data governance frameworks, and what steps and conditions must be in place in order to ensure the exchange of value. New resources developed for the project (available at DataCollaboratives.org) aim to: map the current data collaboratives ecosystem, articulate policies and frameworks for responsibly sharing data for the public good, and help practitioners operationalize this next generation of public-private partnership to solve big public problems, including but not limited to improving the lives of children around the world.</p>
  background: >
    <p>Recent years have seen exponential growth in the amount of data being generated and stored around the world. There is increasing recognition that this data can play a key role in solving some of the most difficult public problems we face – including problems facing children around the world. However, much of the potentially useful data is currently privately held and not available for public insights. Data in the form of web clicks, social “likes,” geolocation and online purchases are typically tightly controlled, usually by entities in the private sector. Companies today generate an ever-growing stream of information from our proliferating sensors and devices. Increasingly, they—and various other actors—are asking if there is a way to make this data available for the public good. There is an ongoing search for new models of corporate responsibility in the digital era around data toward the creation of “data collaboratives”.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Information about internet governance is scattered and hard to find.</li>
      <li>Internet governance is a global issue that requires collaboration and coordination, yet identifying who is already working on what issue within and across countries is currently difficult;</li>
      <li>Information sharing on Internet governance can enable bottom-up participation and lead to increasingly legitimate and effective solutions</li>

  background: >
    <p>In 2014, GovLab launched Open Data 500 (www.opendata500.com), supported by the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation. The OD500 is the first comprehensive study of U.S. based companies that use open government data as a key business resource. The name “OD500” originates from the research ambition to identify 500 U.S. companies that are using open government data. The tool provides a way to map and visualize the relationships between companies and open government datasets, as well as to conduct other sector-by-sector analyses. </p>

  short_description: >
    <p>Network of Innovators (NoI) is a skill sharing network enabling government and civic innovators to assess their problem-solving skills and get matched to those with complementary knowledge for mutual learning.</p>
  long_description: >
    <p>NoI is premised on the belief that traditional titles and academic credentials do not adequately convey the skills and experiences people have and would willingly share.  By promoting the exchange of knowledge about more agile, data-driven, open and collaborative approaches to working, NoI aims to enhance how we govern and solve public problems.</p>
  background: >
    <p>There is possibly no more important public issue today than how to enable our governing organizations to recognize and implement innovative and effective solutions to problems. Administrations that are supposed to solve critical problems on their own are inadequate for a complex, networked world. Governments need to learn to make use of the expertise of others — formal scientific knowledge and credentials, skills and experiences inside and outside of government — to tackle the challenges society will face in the coming years.</p>

  short_description: >
    <p>The GovLab is designing and operationalizing an expert network tool at NYU where data science expertise can be found and made manifest by internal users as well as external decision-makers like policymakers in the White House, Congress, and other public institutions. The goal is to overcome the practical problem that there is currently no way for policymakers to find specialized outside expertise quickly. In developing a working prototype, we are testing the hypothesis that when people are matched to the right opportunity to answer compelling questions on the basis of their skills, they are more likely to use their skills to solve public policy dilemmas.</p>
  background: >
    <p>In mid-2013, The GovLab was invited to advise New York University on how to use cutting-edge Information & Communication Technology  tools and an open innovation process for collaborative decision-making. Called the Open Peer Engagement Network (Open NYU), the goal of the project has been to develop techniques and platforms for NYU to tap into the knowledge and talents that exist within its diverse community of students, faculty, staff, researchers, alumni and administrative leadership.</p>

    </ul>
  background: >
    <p>Both corporate identities and activities remain too opaque and complex to get a full 3D view of any given company. To gain a greater understanding of corporations and their activities, the OrgPedia project aims to prototype the tools, processes and incentives for combining open government data, such as regulatory filings, with open private data, such as NGO reports, and crowdsourced data gathered from individuals about companies.</p>

    <p>Legisletters is an automatic web crawler that gathers and classifies letters written by Members of Congress from legislators' websites. Because letters often are published in ways that are difficult to automatically read, in particular PDF formats, we have a long-term vision of user participation to improve the quality of Legisletters:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Engaging the offices of congresspeople to help them publish their documents in open formats.</li>
      <li>Asking users to improve the quality of existing letters by allowing them to classify different sections and fix errors.</li>
      <li>Permitting the addition of letters that have not been automatically discovered, both by link and upload.</li>
    </ul>
  background: >
    <p>Members of Congress send formal “oversight” letters to cabinet departments and independent agencies on a dizzying array of topics. These letters can contain many different kinds of “asks” of the executive branch, including issuing or revising a particular regulation, changing an interpretation of an existing rule, initiating an investigation and many others. Such communication is a core component of Congress’s oversight work and a key way for Members to shape policy. Yet, there exists no simple, accessible way to discover which Members have written which agencies on which issues, and with what outcomes. The Legisletters project aims to fix that by creating a living, searchable archive of the formal letters that Members of Congress send.</p>

  problem_statement: How can we give decision-makers the information necessary to develop impactful crowdsourcing initiatives?
  short_description: >
    <p>Through a guided interview, the Crowdsourcing Advisor not only helps to identify the key elements one must consider when designing a crowdsourcing project, but also provides a report of the most important case studies (drawn from our knowledge-base) and learnings tailored to the needs and circumstances of the user.</p>
  background: >
    <p>Knowing when and how to use crowdsourcing is hard: there are more than 40 different definitions of crowdsourcing; there is little conclusive evidence of what works and when and, even though there is an abundance of tools and examples, information is disorganized and not well-suited to help a decision-maker know what to do. Under the assumption that there is no single right way of doing crowdsourcing but, rather, engagement must be tailored to each needs and circumstances, the Advisor builds on the experience of others and attempts to help decision-makers in the public and private sectors make an informed decision about when and how to use crowdsourcing.</p>

  problem_statement: 'How to obtain more usable data about the nonprofit sector and whether open data can improve the performance of nonprofits' #question
  short_description: >
    <p>We argue in this paper that open 990 data may increase transparency for nonprofit organizations, making it easier for state and federal authorities to detect fraud, spur innovation in the nonprofit sector and, above all, help us to understand the potential value of the 990 data. However, as also is the case for the 990s, “liberating” government data from paper-based technologies and processes is neither straightforward nor free. While myriad benefits may justify the costs, there is a need for practical strategies to overcome technical, political, and cultural impediments. In addition to exploring the costs and benefits of strategies for achieving open 990 data, the paper focused on how to build a community willing to examine the quality of 990 data and build innovative tools to create a better understanding of the nonprofit sector than we currently have and that we so desperately need.</p>
  tooltip:
  long_description:
  background: >
    <p>In 2010, there were 1.5 million tax-exempt organizations in the United States with $1.51 trillion in revenues. Through the Form 990 in its several varieties, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) gathers a large amount of information about tax-exempt organizations. Like other important data collected by governments, information contained in the 990s could potentially be far more useful if it were not only public but “open” data that are available to all, free of charge, in a standard format, published without proprietary conditions, and available online as a bulk download rather than only through single-entry lookup. This report was designed to address whether and how making the Form 990 data truly open in this sense would not only make it easier to use for the organizations that already process it, but would also make it useful to researchers, advocates, entrepreneurs, technologists, and nonprofits that do not have the resources to use the data in its current form. </p>

    <p>As a result in part of the work done in collaboration with and under the auspices of the Aspen Institute to make the case for opening up IRS-held data about the nonprofit sector and to explain why this could be transformative, the IRS issued a statement on June 30, 2015 that: “The IRS has made substantial progress in developing a technology solution that, when perfected, will allow the IRS to provide electronically-filed Forms 990 in a machine-readable format. This solution will ensure that sensitive or personally identifiable information continues to be protected from public distribution. The IRS expects that this technology solution should be in place in early 2016.”</p>

  problem_statement: Can crowdsourcing improve the quality of patent applications?
  short_description: >
    <p>Developed and run by the New York Law School Institute for Information Law and Policy (the precursor to the GovLab @ NYU), Peer To Patent is a historic initiative by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Patent_and_Trademark_Office" target="_blank">United States Patent and Trademark Office</a> (USPTO) that opens the patent examination process to public participation for the first time. Peer to Patent is an online system that aims to improve the quality of issued patents by enabling the public to supply the USPTO with information relevant to assessing the claims of pending patent applications.This pilot project connects an open network for community input to the legal decision-making process. The community supplies information and research based on its expertise. The patent examiner makes the final determination on the basis of legal standards. This process combines the democracy of open participation with the legitimacy and effectiveness of administrative decision making.</p>
  tooltip:
  long_description:
  background: >
    <p>The Peer To Patent project is an initiative that seeks to assist patent offices in improving patent quality by gathering public input in a structured, productive manner. Peer To Patent is the first social-software project directly linked to decision-making by the federal government. An initial pilot project in collaboration with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) was completed June 15, 2009. That pilot examined more than 220 patent applications in the fields of software and business methods. The Peer To Patent project has issued two anniversary reports from the initial pilot. Following the conclusion of the initial pilot the USPTO undertook an evaluation of Peer To Patent assisted by students from Worcester Polytechnic Institute. That evaluation concluded that the program had merit and should be continued. On October 19, 2010, the USPTO and New York Law School jointly announced a new pilot program commencing October 25, 2010, and continuing through September 30, 2011 (with the review period extending through December 31, 2011). This new pilot included patent applications covering subject matter included in the initial pilot, it also included telecommunications, speech recognition, translation, biotechnology, bioinformatics and biopharmaceuticals.</p>

    <p>Peer to Patent was the first expert network used in government. It catalyzed similar pilot projects including UK Intellectual Property Office, IP Australia, the Japan Patent Office, and the Korean Intellectual Property Office and led, eventually, to a relaxation of the rules against third party protests against pending patent applications. Those policy changes became enshrined in law in the America Invents Acts (2011). In 2011, New York Law School recommended that Stack Exchange use its Q&A platform, Stack Overflow, to run citizen engagement in patent examination and Ask Patents was established: http://patents.stackexchange.com/. Subsequently, the White House named a Presidential Innovation Fellow in 2014-15 to continue the project and ensure that citizen engagement would become part of mainstream patent practice at the USPTO. That Fellow - Christopher Wong - joined the GovLab in 2015. This pathbreaking citizen participation initiative, which demonstrated that, if asked, people would participate in ways that could help civil servants make a better informed decision, was the inspiration for the White House Open Government Initiative, launched during the first term of the Obama Presidency in 2009.</p>

  problem_statement: Can targeting opportunities to participate in regulatory reviews of medical devices based on skills and experience improve efficacy?
  short_description: >
    <p>As one of its duties, the Food and Drug Administration manages the process of pre-market approval of all medical devices to ensure that patients and providers have timely access to safe, effective, and high quality devices, as well as the post-market review of medical devices to ensure that any unsafe medical devices are identified and recalled from the market. In both of these contexts, the FDA seeks to provide the medical device industry with productive, consistent, transparent, and efficient regulatory pathways.</p>
    <p>In a pilot program, the GovLab, MacArthur Foundation Research Network on Opening Governance and partners will evaluate several potential impacts of the introduction of a piece of expert networking software, FDA Profiles. This software is designed to decrease frictions in identifying qualified government employees to participate in medical device regulatory review panels. FDA Profiles aggregates information about the expertise of potential reviewers including information from internal databases, publications on PubMed, and self-reported information about an individual’s skills and experience.</p>
  tooltip:
  long_description:
  background: >
    <p>With thousands of devices -- sometimes leveraging cutting-edge technology -- to examine each year, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is faced with the challenge of finding the right internal and external expertise to help the agency quickly study a device’s safety and efficacy. Done right, lives can be saved and companies can prosper from bringing innovations to market. Done wrong, bad devices kill.</p>
  social_media: #in the future we can have custom shareable messages for each project

    <p>The experimentation around the rollout of FDA Profiles will allow researchers to identify how and when changes in the assembly, composition, and efficiency of a review panel change when expert networking software is introduced and will identify the impact of the software on each of these factors.  </p>
    <p>Additionally, the agile empirical manner in which the experimentation will occur will seek to accelerate the pace of research by developing replicable methods for studying governance innovations in the wild.</p>

  problem_statement: Develop recommendations on how to use crowdlaw to improve the quality of lawmaking. We want to explore when and under what circumstances engagement can result in lawmaking that is either more legitimate, more effective or both.
  short_description: >
    <p>Crowdlaw is an emerging field of practice that is comprised of lawyers, platform developers, lawyers, government employees and research scientists, among others including citizen advocates. GovLab plays a convening role to engage practitioners from around the world and has initiated a dialogue in order to identify case studies and pilots, assess impact and inspire greater innovation across political, government and civil society actors.</p>
  tooltip: >
    <p></p>
  long_description: >
    <p>CrowdLaw is the practice of using technology to tap the intelligence and expertise of the public in order to improve the quality of lawmaking. Around the world, there are already over two dozen examples of local legislatures and national parliaments turning to the Internet to involve the public in legislative drafting and decision-making. These ambitious crowdlaw initiatives show that the public can, in many cases, go beyond contributing opinions and signing petitions online to playing a more substantive role, including: proposing legislation, drafting bills, monitoring implementation, and supplying missing data. Through such processes, the public becomes collaborators and co-creators in the legislative process to the end of improving the quality of legislative outcomes and the effectiveness of governing.</p>
    <p>Crowdlaw offers an alternative to the traditional method of lawmaking, which is typically done by professional staff and politicians working behind closed doors and with little direct input from the people legislation affects. Instead, we start from the hypothesis that crowdlaw has the potential to enhance the quality of legislation. Designed right, with the aim of improving the quality of outputs, there are opportunities at each stage of the lawmaking process, including problem definition, solution identification, research and drafting, subsequent crafting of implementing regulations, and monitoring of outcomes, to introduce greater expertise into the legislative process efficiently. At the same time, we acknowledge that, designed wrong, without regard for outcomes, engagement may only hamstring decision-making and deepen distrust of government. Thus, we approach this project not as evangelists but as critical researchers whose aim is to understand what works and when.</p>
    <p>GovLab is supporting legislative bodies in investigating, designing, implementing, and testing crowdlaw initiatives. Our work includes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Studying and sharing learnings about CrowdLaw practices in use around the world and convening practitioners to share learnings.</li>
      <li>Synthesizing best practices for the design of CrowdLaw initiatives — including platforms, processes, and policies — through an on-going survey of over 25 public engagement initiatives.</li>
      <li>Cultivating a thriving network of now more than 90 CrowdLaw and public engagement experts and practitioners.</li>
      <li>Crafting a model legal framework to accelerate the integration of public input into the legislative process.</li>
      <li>Advising on the implementation of CrowdLaw practices.</li>
    </ul>
  background: >
    <p>With rates of trust in government at historic lows, the legitimacy of traditional representative models of lawmaking — often conducted by professional staff and politicians working behind closed doors and distorted by political party agendas–is called into question. New forms of public participation could help to improve both legitimacy and effectiveness by introducing more data and diverse viewpoints at each stage of the lawmaking process.</p>

  short_description: >
    <p>In collaboration with GrantCraft, a service of Foundation Center, The GovLab is exploring how new innovations can increase the openness and effectiveness of grantmaking. In a number of publications available on Medium, we sketch out the range and potential impact of open and effective grantmaking innovations at all stages of the process. Through these posts, we asking readers to help us gather and curate information about open and effective grantmaking innovations, analyze their potential uses, and encourage their adoption where appropriate. This open input process is a first toward building a conversation and a broader case for putting grantmaking innovations into practice throughout government at all levels.</p>
  background: >
    <p>Grantmaking plays a vital role in helping our government, our researchers, and our communities confront 21st-century challenges. Yet we still have a decidedly 20th-century system in place for deciding how we make these billions of dollars of crucial investments. In order to make the most of limited funding — and to help build confidence in the ability of public investments to make a positive difference — it is essential for our government agencies to try more strategic approaches to designing, awarding, and measuring their grantmaking.</p>

    <p>In collaboration with <a href="https://www.omidyar.com/" target="_blank">Omidyar Network</a>, the GovLab has conducted <strong>19 detailed case studies of open data projects around the world</strong> and developed a key findings paper describing lessons learned across the projects examined. The case studies were selected for their sectoral and geographic representativeness. They were built in part from secondary sources (“desk research”), but also from a number of first-hand interviews with important players and key stakeholders. The case studies, key findings paper and other resources will be posted on the Open Data’s Impact repository in early 2016.</p>
  background: >
    <p>Recent years have witnessed considerable enthusiasm over open data. Several studies have documented its potential to spur economic innovation and social transformation, and to usher in fresh forms of political and government accountability. Yet for all the enthusiasm, we know little about how open data actually works, and what forms of impact it is really having.</p>

    <p>A GovLab initiative to design and test how public decision-making could improve if institutions knew how to leverage citizens’ and civil servants’ expertise.</p>

    <p></p>
  long_description: >
    <p>New tools—what GovLab calls technologies of expertise— are making it possible to match the supply of citizen expertise to the demand for it in government. Smarter State is a GovLab initiative to design and test how public decision-making could improve if institutions knew how to use the technologies of expertise to tap the wisdom of citizens’ and civil servants.</p>
  background: >
    <p>Government “of the people, by the people, for the people” expresses an ideal that resonates in all democracies. Yet poll after poll reveals deep distrust of institutions that seem to have left “the people” out of the equation. Government bureaucracies that are supposed to solve critical problems on their own are a troublesome outgrowth of the professionalization of public life in the industrial age. They are especially ill-suited to confronting today’s complex challenges. Offering a far-reaching program for innovation, the book Smart Citizens, Smarter State by Beth Simone Noveck suggests that public decision-making could be more effective and legitimate if our institutions knew how to use technology to leverage citizens’ expertise.
    </p><p>Drawing on a wide range of disciplines and practical examples from her work as an adviser to governments on innovation, Noveck explores how to create more open and collaborative institutions. She puts forward a profound new vision for participatory democracy rooted not in the paltry act of occasional voting or the serendipity of crowdsourcing, but in people’s knowledge and know-how.</p>

  problem_statement: How can targeted crowdsourcing help the City of Quito, Ecuador get smarter about how to prepare for a likely volcano eruption? #question
  short_description:
  tooltip:
  long_description: >
    <p>The online sessions had the intention to help the city of Quito: better define and understand the nature of the problem; help connect those people with relevant experience and know how to city officials to help Quito better manage the impending disaster; identify innovative and practical ways, especially using new technology, to tackle the challenge at hand; and, last but not least, find out ways to do things differently and potentially save lives by optimizing resources and financing solutions for the ow for money to be spent on what matters most.</p>
    <p>The issues discussed during each session were identified by the Risk Department of the Secretary of Security of the Municipality of Quito. Overall, the topics essentially focused on communications (within the Government and messages to the public), mobility plans, risk issues and evacuation plans among.</p>
  background: >
    <p>Through a curated call for help to global experts, the GovLab Academy organized a series of online advice and mentoring sessions to help the city of Quito get smarter about how to prepare for the then (September 2015) likely eruption of the Cotopaxi Volcano.</p>
    <p>At the time of the call, Cotopaxi was spewing ash (latest images below). The last large-scale eruption was in 1877, and it was believed that another one is inevitable. If it erupts, some communities will have less than half an hour to evacuate.The scale of the challenge is overwhelming. However, by mobilizing expertise - both credentialed know-how and experiential wisdom - we hoped to bring the best thinking to bear and translate good ideas for how to mitigate the risks and create actionable proposals, especially using technology and innovation.</p>

    <p>This project was the first effort to solicit expertise and help for emergency response before the disaster happens. 65 international experts self-selected themselves to join online coaching sessions and help the City of Quito leverage their expertise on specific problems like:
      <ul>
        <li>Coordination of communication,</li>
        <li>Evacuation planning,</li>
        <li>Cost-effective shelters,</li>
        <li>Citizen sensing and citizen science.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>As a result of the collective analysis of the problem, a single major problem was identified: the absence of real-time data before, during and after the disaster. If officials could have access to real-time data directly from citizens, information gaps could be bridged so authorities can take better and data-driven decisions.</p>
    <p>The latter materialized in the development of <strong><em>Mi Quito Reporta*</em></strong>, a two-way communications platform between authorities and the community to be used as the mechanism for people to express their worries and create real-time reports of relevant issued, and for authorities to collect meaningful data and push out the latest information.</p>
    <p>*The beta version of tool is ready as a web service and also available for <a href="http://tu-reportas.devsu.us/">download</a> (Android and iOS)</p>

  problem_statement: 12-month pilot which took place in the Municipality of San Pedro Garza García, Mexico, designed to evaluate a replicable process for Latin American cities to solve social problems more quickly and effectively. #question

  long_description: >
    <p>The goal of the project was to pilot and evaluate a replicable process for Latin American cities to tap into the skills, talents and abilities of diverse citizens to solve social problems more quickly and effectively. By creating the “conversational infrastructure” -- method and tools -- to source and implement novel approaches from civil servants and the public, the hope is to spark a potential shift from the traditional top-down, closed governing approaches to more decentralized, collaborative, and open practices of solving public problems using the intelligence of the public seriously and encouraging active forms of citizenship. Rather than relying on a single approach, such as prize-backed challenges, the design of the project utilizes open innovation to source a wide array of ideas and combines it with ICT-enabled training to shape those ideas into implementable new policies and services.
    </p>
  background: >
    <p>W​ith trust in government at an all-time low, it is imperative to demonstrate alternative strategies for how to govern in ways that are more inclusive and participatory. To that end, public institutions are turning to open innovation--also known as crowdsourcing--to open up the process of identifying both good ideas and the evidence to support their implementation to citizens, civil servants, and organizations.</p>
    <p>The specific people-led innovation method employed in the San Pedro Garza García pilot project enabled the municipality to solve problems and to obtain evidence that demonstrated if, when, and how decentralized, collaborative, and open practices of solving public problems resulted in new creative, data-driven, cost-effective and citizen-centric policies and services.</p>

    <p>Over the course of 2016, the GovLab, in collaboration with the Mayor’s Office of the Municipality of San Pedro Garza García (SPGG) in Mexico, undertook to:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><b>DESIGN:</b> We developed and launched five open innovation challenges designed to solicit good ideas (from the public and civil servants) to solve hard problems facing the municipality.</li>
    <li><b>TRAIN:</b> We trained 50 challenge winners to further develop their proposals into actionable and implementable policies, resulting in 10 developed projects.</li>
    <li><b>CONNECT:</b> We supported the desire for peer-to-peer learning by building an expert network of global and local experts to support the problem definition efforts done by the Municipality and, later, the project development efforts done by the selected participants of each challenge. </li>
    <li><b>LEARN:</b> We evaluated the lessons learned from running this pilot to the end of articulating a replicable method for Latin American cities.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>As a result of the pilot project, we were also able to develop a plan for this crowdsourcing method, which leverages expertise from the public and civil servants to effectively transform ideas into implementable proposals, to be replicated in other Latin American cities. This includes the following five key lessons to take into account when designing a problem solving method:</p>

    <p>While it is too early to determine the impact of projects that were developed through the pilot, we have published several reports highlighting our results and launched a project website, all of which can be found in the “More About” section.</p>

    <p>The Bertelsmann Handbook articulates a method for curating and matching the supply of people’s expertise to the demand of urban challenges. When used in sync with other existing methodologies, People-Led Innovation seeks to provide more sustainable, inclusive, and effective policies and services.</p>
    <p>The Methodology comprises four key phases, all aimed at tapping into the expertise of the public through a mix a curation and openness:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Define – engaging people to identify, define, prioritize and curate the problem(s) to be solved through an innovation approach.</li>
    <li>Ideate – curating potential solutions to identified problems by engaging the expertise of the public.</li>
    <li>Experiment – implementing new solutions in an agile manner and curating the capacity needed to test what works in practice. </li>
    <li>Communicate – transferring lessons learned to a wide audience and curating feedback received to enable strategic iteration.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    Additionally, there are four types of engagement to be utilized in people-led solutions:
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>Commenting: In this role, the group provides their opinions or experiences to build upon the problem-solving team’s ideas.</li>
    <li>Co-creating: Stakeholder groups are asked to apply their skills and creativity to develop definitions, solutions, or priorities with the problem-solving team.</li>
    <li>Reviewing: Similar to the ‘Commenting’ role, stakeholder groups are asked to provide their insights and opinions. However, in this step, the groups are seeking to assess and evaluate proposals and/or interventions.</li>
    <li>Reporting: In the Reporting role, groups are asked to contribute data and add facts to problem definitions, solution plans, and evaluations.</li>
    </ul>

  background: >
    <p>Cities worldwide are seeking to become more resilient to environmental, social, and economic shocks and stresses. However, traditional methods and existing resources often fall short of tackling today’s challenges. Cities need not only provide innovative solutions to a complex array of problems, they also need to innovate in the way that they develop these solutions.</p>

  long_description: >
    <p>In this report, we focus on an approach to extract public value from social media data that we believe holds the greatest potential: data collaboratives. Data collaboratives are an emerging form of public-private partnership in which actors from different sectors exchange information to create new public value. Such collaborative arrangements, for example between social media companies and humanitarian organizations or civil society actors, can be seen as possible templates for leveraging privately held data towards the attainment of public goals.</p>
  background: >
    <p>The twenty-first century will be challenging on many fronts. From historically catastrophic natural disasters resulting from climate change to inequality to refugee and terrorism crises, it is clear that we need not only new solutions, but new insights and methods of arriving at solutions. Data, and the intelligence gained from it through advances in data science, is increasingly being seen as part of the answer. However, a vast amount of valuable data is held by private companies.</p>

    <p>This data collaborative project seeks to create a Data Collaborative on Gender and Urban Mobility to pair official government data (census, transport, crime report, socioeconomic indicators) with high-definition satellite imagery from DigitalGlobe, and aggregated, anonymized Call Detail Records from Telefonica to create create a human landscape and mobility map of Santiago.</p>
  background: >
    <p>Transportation planning in Chile and elsewhere rarely accounts for gender, yet these decisions impact the urban mobility of women and girls in a number of different ways. For example, women and girls often engage in multi-purpose, multi-stop trips. Safety is also a major concern for women and girls. The location of bus stops or how well-lit streets are can affect movement. The World Health Organization estimates that over 2,000 people die each year as a result of road accidents in the country. Sexual harassment is also a recurring obstacle, with 5 out of 10 women in Chile reporting sexual harassment on the street.</p>

    <p>Convened and organized by the GovLab, and made possible by five years of funding support from the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, the MacArthur Foundation Research Network on Opening Governance works to develop the blueprints for more effective and legitimate democratic institutions to the end of improving people’s lives. A core group of twelve members is complemented by an advisory network of academics, technologists, and current and former government officials. Through both face-to-face and online collaboration, the Network is focused on assessing existing innovations in governing and experimenting with new practices and, eventually new norms, for how our institutions make decisions at the local, national, and international level.</p>
  background: >
    <p>Research networks are a signature MacArthur “way of working.” They are designed to identify a big problem and bring together researchers, practitioners, and policymakers from multiple disciplines to work collaboratively over an extended period of time, typically six to as many as ten years. Ambitious and innovative −but not prescriptive−research networks liberate their members to pursue work that has the potential to change prevailing paradigms.</p>
    <p>Unlike project support or institutional operating support, research networks create a more open space for ideation and collaboration, with the goal of breaking new ground on big, timely challenges. Intensive preparatory activities to frame research network inquiries, identify network members, and vet initial and renewal network proposals with outside experts increase the potential for research networks not only to make distinctive conceptual contributions, but also to have real-world relevance and impact.

    <p>Blockchange will seek to test the hypothesis that by applying blockchain attributes to identity management, a trusted digital ID can be created that can benefit, for instance:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>The estimated 1.1 billion people who are unable to prove their identity to the satisfaction of authorities and other organizations – often excluding them from property ownership, free movement, and social protection as a result;</li>
    <li>The 1.3 million refugees that are trying to relocate around the world but can’t be identified; and</li>
    <li>All the women and girls, who disproportionately struggle to obtain IDs, often the result of barriers related to: freedom of travel, distance, financial costs, time constraints, illiteracy, lack of information and awareness, and lack of support from family members.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To become smarter about the application of blockchain technologies for identity, Blockchange will initially seek to:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Map, and provide a taxonomy of blockchain technologies that seeks to provide identity;</li>
    <li>Develop a primer on the potential and challenges of blockchain technologies across the identity life-cycle (such as creation; verification; authentication; and authorization);</li>
    <li>Map the actual use of identity provided through blockchain technologies for a variety of social good purposes through case studies; and</li>
    <li>Co-develop a set of (evidence-based) design principles that can guide the further development and use of blockchain for social change.</li>
    </ul>
  background: >
    <p>In 2008, an unknown source calling itself Satoshi Nakamoto released a paper named Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System which introduced Blockchain. Blockchain is a novel technology that uses a distributed ledger to record transactions and ensure compliance. Blockchain and other Distributed Ledger technologies (DLTs) rely on an ability to act as a vast, transparent, and secure public database.
    </p><p>Distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) have disruptive potential beyond innovation in products, services, revenue streams and operating systems within industry. By providing transparency and accountability in new and distributed ways, DLTs have the potential to positively empower underserved populations in myriad ways, including providing a means for establishing a trusted digital identity.

    <p>The explosion in the availability of new sources of data and the emergence of new data science technologies for making use of such data are expected to have a significant impact on public institutions and how they solve problems and make decisions.</p>

      <p>Whether the goal is improved outcomes and equities, reduced cost and inefficiency, more evidence about what works or the identification of new operational solutions, the ability to use data is becoming essential to governing well in the 21st century.</p>

      <p>Much of the promise of such data-driven and evidence-based decisionmaking has failed to materialize because those in public institutions lack the experience needed for turning data into actionable insights. Even those with quantitative skills often confront legal or technical impediments making it difficult to know how to collect, analyze, use, share, and store data responsibly and ethically.</p>

      <p>Solving Public Problems with Data examines how data can be used to improve decisionmaking and problem solving in the public sector. Through real world examples and case studies, we discuss the fundamental principles of data science to help foster a data analytic mindset. The goal is to enable you to define and leverage the value of data to achieve your public mission. No prior experience with computer science or statistics is necessary or assumed.</p>

    <p>Data Labs is a model for evaluating the effectiveness of social programs using administrative data. This project will investigate how and where it can be replicated and aim to initiate pilots. We developed a series of case studies containing a detailed analysis of six data lab models in the United States and one from the United Kingdom based on interviews. It is meant to better our understanding of the existing landscape of data labs and to learn from their successes and drawbacks. In particular, we look at the governance processes that they employ to share or access data and how these labs solicit expertise to enable program evaluation. In collaboration with UK-based non-profit, New Philanthropy Capital, our goal is to provide data owners, particularly those who have personally-identifiable data, with a blueprint to securely, responsibly and ethically share that information to the end of improving programs in the public interest.</p>
  background: >
    <p>While they have long collected data, increasingly in digital form, government agencies have struggled to create the infrastructure and acquire the skills needed to make use of this administrative data to realize the promise of evidence-based policymaking. But some states are already out ahead, establishing offices known as Data Labs or Policy Labs to enable states to partner with academia and make use of state administrative data to evaluate and ultimately improve programs and policies. By establishing the necessary technical infrastructure and governance mechanisms to help government gain access to much-needed analytical talent, these data labs are helping to convert data into insights and driving more evidence-based policymaking and service delivery. Urgently needed, however, are more such labs with the capacity to turn the data government collects into improvements in policies and services and the expansion of existing labs to enable nonprofits as well as government to evaluate their offerings using state data.</p>
