    <p>Docker for Data is a cloud-based open source toolkit to speed up the extraction and loading of large open datasets. It gives open data users a command that can install a broad variety of data sets into a SQL database directly. A user can load data like New York City’s deeds and mortgages directly into a powerful SQL database in just minutes instead of hours. </p>

    <p>Docker for Data is a cloud-based open source toolkit to speed up the extraction and loading of large open datasets. It gives open data users a command that can install a broad variety of data sets into a SQL database directly. A user can load data like New York City’s deeds and mortgages directly into a powerful SQL database in just minutes instead of hours.</p>
    <p>Users no longer have to worry about schemas, transformations, load processes, or waiting for slow data portals.  Data from many formats is standardized and ready to go, fast. Installation is a snap: users don’t even need a SQL database installed beforehand. Docker for Data can be installed with <a href="https://github.com/talos/docker4data#try-it-out" target="_blank">one line of code</a>.</p>
  background: >
    <p>Existing open data portals are focused on views of single data sets in the browser. This is great until you need to do deep analysis or build a business on it.</p>
    <p>Downloading big datasets can take hours. It can take many more hours finding the location of important small datasets, especially those not living on the same portal. Add in a few more hours to load everything into a real database and figure out the relations, and you've spent days (or thousands of dollars) on something trivial. </p>
    <p>It doesn’t have to be this hard.</p>

    <p>Because Docker for Data archives the extracted data sets, it functions as a repository for usable open data. On Docker, you can find:</p>

      <li>8229 datasets</li>

    <p>Based on our experience <a href="http://govlabacademy.org/" target="_blank">teaching civic innovators</a>, the GovLab designed the Public Projects Canvas, a 20-question, collaborative framework to help those working on civic projects to become more impactful. In contrast to developing the business plan for a for-profit product, public projects demand consideration of key issues not captured by traditional canvasses, such as Sustainability and Impact, which are captured by the GovLab Canvas. </p>

    <p>At GovLab, we are using canvas for our internal projects and also for the coaching of 'students' in the context of the GovLab Academy. A canvas is a good way to bootstrap a brand new project. It can be also very useful for existing projects or even past projects.</p>
  background: >
    <p>According to Forbes, the Valley of Death is a common term in the startup world, referring to the difficulty of covering the negative cash flow in the early stages of a startup. For most Public interest projects,  the common death-traps include: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Defining the problem clearly</li>
      <li>Knowing how to navigate the necessary bureaucracies</li>
      <li>Developing compelling materials to convince the decision-makers</li>
      <li>Identifying how to measure what works.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Canvases - proven frameworks to facilitate idea generation & structured discussions - have been widely used by companies and entrepreneurs; but not so much by non-profits or social actors, as they haven’t been able to capture the challenges that are unique to social and public ventures.</p>

  background: >
    <p>Although many schools and programs teach the skills relevant to business innovation, aspiring public and social sector innovators have very few places to turn to receive the mentoring and support needed to take a technology-driven governance innovation project across a wide range of social issues from idea to implementation.

  background: >
    <p>Several of society’s greatest challenges — from addressing climate change to public health to job creation — require greater access to data. Yet for all the potential for using big data, a limiting factor is that much of the data valuable for solving public problems resides within the private sector. If we truly want to leverage the potential of data to improve people’s lives, then we need to accelerate the creation and use of “data collaboratives” in which participants from different sectors — including private companies, research institutions, and government agencies — can exchange data to help solve public problems.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Information about internet governance is scattered and hard to find.</li>
      <li>Internet governance is a global issue that requires collaboration and coordination, yet identifying who is already working on what issue within and across countries is currently difficult;</li>

  short_description: >
    <p>An expert network to match innovative individuals, organizations and the projects they have worked on within and across governments. NoI adopts a more nuanced way of sharing and finding expertise — one that looks beyond traditional credentials to focus on real world know-how. Instead of rigid categories or open-ended tags, NoI attempts to get at what people know by asking the kinds of questions they could answer. In response to those questions, they can specify the expertise they have and want to share: whether they have the ability to do something, to tell someone about it, or to refer them to others knowledgeable about the topic.</p>
  long_description:
  background: >
    <p>There is possibly no more important public issue today than how to enable our governing organizations to recognize and implement innovative and effective solutions to problems. Administrations that are supposed to solve critical problems on their own are inadequate for a complex, networked world. Governments need to learn to make use of the expertise of others — formal scientific knowledge and credentials, skills and experiences inside and outside of government — to tackle the challenges society will face in the coming years.</p>

  short_description: >
    <p>The GovLab is designing and operationalizing an expert network tool at NYU where data science expertise can be found and made manifest by internal users as well as external decision-makers like policymakers in the White House, Congress, and other public institutions. The goal is to overcome the practical problem that there is currently no way for policymakers to find specialized outside expertise quickly. In developing a working prototype, we are testing the hypothesis that when people are matched to the right opportunity to answer compelling questions on the basis of their skills, they are more likely to use their skills to solve public policy dilemmas.</p>
  background: >
    <p>In mid-2013, The GovLab was invited to advise New York University on how to use cutting-edge Information & Communication Technology  tools and an open innovation process for collaborative decision-making. Called the Open Peer Engagement Network (Open NYU), the goal of the project has been to develop techniques and platforms for NYU to tap into the knowledge and talents that exist within its diverse community of students, faculty, staff, researchers, alumni and administrative leadership.</p>

Because letters often are published in ways that are difficult to automatically read, in particular PDF formats, we have a long-term vision of user participation to improve the quality of Legisletters:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Engaging the offices of congresspeople to help them publish their documents in open formats.</li>
      <li>Asking users to improve the quality of existing letters by allowing them to classify different sections and fix errors.</li>
      <li>Permitting the addition of letters that have not been automatically discovered, both by link and upload.</li>
    </ul>
  background: >
    <p>Members of Congress send formal “oversight” letters to cabinet departments and independent agencies on a dizzying array of topics. These letters can contain many different kinds of “asks” of the executive branch, including issuing or revising a particular regulation, changing an interpretation of an existing rule, initiating an investigation and many others. Such communication is a core component of Congress’s oversight work and a key way for Members to shape policy. Yet, there exists no simple, accessible way to discover which Members have written which agencies on which issues, and with what outcomes. The Legisletters project aims to fix that by creating a living, searchable archive of the formal letters that Members of Congress send.</p>

  short_description: >
    <p>Through a guided interview, the Crowdsourcing Advisor not only helps to identify the key elements one must consider when designing a crowdsourcing project, but also provides a report of the most important case studies (drawn from our knowledge-base) and learnings tailored to the needs and circumstances of the user.</p>
  background: >
    <p>Knowing when and how to use crowdsourcing is hard: there are more than 40 different definitions of crowdsourcing; there is little conclusive evidence of what works and when and, even though there is an abundance of tools and examples, information is disorganized and not well-suited to help a decision-maker know what to do. Under the assumption that there is no single right way of doing crowdsourcing but, rather, engagement must be tailored to each needs and circumstances, the Advisor builds on the experience of others and attempts to help decision-makers in the public and private sectors make an informed decision about when and how to use crowdsourcing.</p>

    <p>Building on the GovLab’s experience in data-driven governance innovation in the fields of health care and education and working closely with a Criminal Justice Data and Innovation fellow working with the U.S. Chief Data Scientist at the White House, we are embarking on a year long project to analyze and document how data flows through the criminal justice system, identify policy and legal barriers to effective data sharing, and create pilot projects to replicate successful innovations in the field or test new approaches. Recognizing that many jurisdictions have already tackled these problems, we are actively seeking insights from experts in the field at the local, state and federal level to identify innovation already occurring, brainstorm new approaches, and build out key policies to help improve and expand criminal justice data sharing.</p>

  problem_statement: 'How to obtain more usable data about the nonprofit sector and whether open data can improve the performance of nonprofits' #question
  short_description: >
    <p>We argue in this paper that open 990 data may increase transparency for nonprofit organizations, making it easier for state and federal authorities to detect fraud, spur innovation in the nonprofit sector and, above all, help us to understand the potential value of the 990 data. However, as also is the case for the 990s, “liberating” government data from paper-based technologies and processes is neither straightforward nor free. While myriad benefits may justify the costs, there is a need for practical strategies to overcome technical, political, and cultural impediments. In addition to exploring the costs and benefits of strategies for achieving open 990 data, the paper focused on how to build a community willing to examine the quality of 990 data and build innovative tools to create a better understanding of the nonprofit sector than we currently have and that we so desperately need.</p>
  tooltip: 
  long_description: 
  background: >
    <p>In 2010, there were 1.5 million tax-exempt organizations in the United States with $1.51 trillion in revenues. Through the Form 990 in its several varieties, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) gathers a large amount of information about tax-exempt organizations. Like other important data collected by governments, information contained in the 990s could potentially be far more useful if it were not only public but “open” data that are available to all, free of charge, in a standard format, published without proprietary conditions, and available online as a bulk download rather than only through single-entry lookup. This report was designed to address whether and how making the Form 990 data truly open in this sense would not only make it easier to use for the organizations that already process it, but would also make it useful to researchers, advocates, entrepreneurs, technologists, and nonprofits that do not have the resources to use the data in its current form. </p>

    <p>As a result in part of the work done in collaboration with and under the auspices of the Aspen Institute to make the case for opening up IRS-held data about the nonprofit sector and to explain why this could be transformative, the IRS issued a statement on June 30, 2015 that: “The IRS has made substantial progress in developing a technology solution that, when perfected, will allow the IRS to provide electronically-filed Forms 990 in a machine-readable format. This solution will ensure that sensitive or personally identifiable information continues to be protected from public distribution. The IRS expects that this technology solution should be in place in early 2016.”</p>

  problem_statement: Can crowdsourcing improve the quality of patent applications?
  short_description: >
    <p>Developed and run by the New York Law School Institute for Information Law and Policy (the precursor to the GovLab @ NYU), Peer To Patent is a historic initiative by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Patent_and_Trademark_Office" target="_blank">United States Patent and Trademark Office</a> (USPTO) that opens the patent examination process to public participation for the first time. Peer to Patent is an online system that aims to improve the quality of issued patents by enabling the public to supply the USPTO with information relevant to assessing the claims of pending patent applications.This pilot project connects an open network for community input to the legal decision-making process. The community supplies information and research based on its expertise. The patent examiner makes the final determination on the basis of legal standards. This process combines the democracy of open participation with the legitimacy and effectiveness of administrative decision making.</p>
  tooltip: 
  long_description:
  background: >
    <p>The Peer To Patent project is an initiative that seeks to assist patent offices in improving patent quality by gathering public input in a structured, productive manner. Peer To Patent is the first social-software project directly linked to decision-making by the federal government. An initial pilot project in collaboration with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) was completed June 15, 2009. That pilot examined more than 220 patent applications in the fields of software and business methods. The Peer To Patent project has issued two anniversary reports from the initial pilot. Following the conclusion of the initial pilot the USPTO undertook an evaluation of Peer To Patent assisted by students from Worcester Polytechnic Institute. That evaluation concluded that the program had merit and should be continued. On October 19, 2010, the USPTO and New York Law School jointly announced a new pilot program commencing October 25, 2010, and continuing through September 30, 2011 (with the review period extending through December 31, 2011). This new pilot included patent applications covering subject matter included in the initial pilot, it also included telecommunications, speech recognition, translation, biotechnology, bioinformatics and biopharmaceuticals.</p>

    <p>Peer to Patent was the first expert network used in government. It catalyzed similar pilot projects including UK Intellectual Property Office, IP Australia, the Japan Patent Office, and the Korean Intellectual Property Office and led, eventually, to a relaxation of the rules against third party protests against pending patent applications. Those policy changes became enshrined in law in the America Invents Acts (2011). In 2011, New York Law School recommended that Stack Exchange use its Q&A platform, Stack Overflow, to run citizen engagement in patent examination and Ask Patents was established: http://patents.stackexchange.com/. Subsequently, the White House named a Presidential Innovation Fellow in 2014-15 to continue the project and ensure that citizen engagement would become part of mainstream patent practice at the USPTO. That Fellow - Christopher Wong - joined the GovLab in 2015. This pathbreaking citizen participation initiative, which demonstrated that, if asked, people would participate in ways that could help civil servants make a better informed decision, was the inspiration for the White House Open Government Initiative, launched during the first term of the Obama Presidency in 2009.</p>

  problem_statement: Can targeting opportunities to participate in regulatory reviews of medical devices based on skills and experience improve efficacy? 
  short_description: >
    <p>As one of its duties, the Food and Drug Administration manages the process of pre-market approval of all medical devices to ensure that patients and providers have timely access to safe, effective, and high quality devices, as well as the post-market review of medical devices to ensure that any unsafe medical devices are identified and recalled from the market. In both of these contexts, the FDA seeks to provide the medical device industry with productive, consistent, transparent, and efficient regulatory pathways.</p>
    <p>In a pilot program, the GovLab, MacArthur Foundation Research Network on Opening Governance and partners will evaluate several potential impacts of the introduction of a piece of expert networking software, FDA Profiles. This software is designed to decrease frictions in identifying qualified government employees to participate in medical device regulatory review panels. FDA Profiles aggregates information about the expertise of potential reviewers including information from internal databases, publications on PubMed, and self-reported information about an individual’s skills and experience.</p>
  tooltip: 
  long_description: 
  background: >
    <p>With thousands of devices -- sometimes leveraging cutting-edge technology -- to examine each year, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is faced with the challenge of finding the right internal and external expertise to help the agency quickly study a device’s safety and efficacy. Done right, lives can be saved and companies can prosper from bringing innovations to market. Done wrong, bad devices kill.</p>

    <p>The experimentation around the rollout of FDA Profiles will allow researchers to identify how and when changes in the assembly, composition, and efficiency of a review panel change when expert networking software is introduced and will identify the impact of the software on each of these factors.  </p>
    <p>Additionally, the agile empirical manner in which the experimentation will occur will seek to accelerate the pace of research by developing replicable methods for studying governance innovations in the wild.</p>

    <p>Access to high quality, relevant data is essential but to make use of that data, public institutions like NHS England also need to build capacity for using data to improve people’s lives. Right now, most public institutions suffer from a “data expertise gap.”</p>
    <p>There is a demand for more expertise, especially in the latest big data tools and techniques and in bringing together those with data science and public health know how to address strategies for turning data into improved health outcomes.</p>
    <p>Even where expertise exists it can be hard to find both within the NHS and across Britain’s universities, making it hard for NHS to realize the benefit without an infrastructure to make that expertise searchable.</p>

    <p>The first stage of the project will involve identifying questions to which the NHS needs answers and measure whether the institution was able to get better, more diverse, more innovative, or faster expertise in response as a result of targeting expertise.</p>

    <p>NHS England and The GovLab released The Open Data Era in Health and Social Care in May 2014 as a model for measuring the impact of open data in healthcare to inform future priorities and investments in open data programs. Specifically, this model identifies and evaluates the following six value propositions for impact measurement:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Accountability:</strong> The use of data to hold healthcare organizations and providers accountable for treatment outcomes.</li>
    <li><strong>Choice:</strong> Providing open data to help patients make informed choices from among the healthcare options available to them.</li>
    <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Improving the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of healthcare delivery.</li>
    <li><strong>Outcomes:</strong> Improving treatment outcomes by using open data to make the results of different treatments, healthcare organizations, and providers’ work more transparent.</li>
    <li><strong>Patient satisfaction and customer service:</strong> Using open data to educate patients and their families and make healthcare institutions more responsive.</li>
    <li><strong>Economic growth and innovation:</strong> Using open data to fuel new healthcare companies and initiatives, and to spur innovation in the broader economy.</li>
    </ul>
  background: >
    <p>The National Health Service England has launched a series of initiatives to begin opening its healthcare data with the intent to positively impact outcomes. Despite widespread recognition of the value proposition of open data, there is little understanding of whether and how open data initiatives definitively lead to improved outcomes in healthcare. This project aims to establish a healthcare open data model that can be used by researchers and program managers to design their open data initiatives and then measure their impact.</p>

    <p>The goal is that researchers and healthcare managers can use this open data model to help design and measure their own open data initiatives.</p>

  problem_statement: How can crowdsourcing enable greater citizen participation in the legislation and constitution drafting process?
  short_description: >
    <p>Crowdlaw is an emerging field of practice that is comprised of lawyers, platform developers, lawyers, government employees and research scientists, among others including citizen advocates. GovLab plays a convening role to engage practitioners from around the world and has initiated a dialogue in order to identify case studies and pilots, assess impact and inspire greater innovation across political, government and civil society actors.</p>

GovLab plays a convening role to engage practitioners from around the world and has initiated a dialogue in order to identify case studies and pilots, assess impact and inspire greater innovation across political, government and civil society actors.</p>
    <p>GovLab has sponsored and organized three online conferences (open to all members of the public) with participants showcasing crowdlaw projects from around the world that include Austria, Chile, Brazil, Finland, Iceland, Italy, Libya, Mexico, Philippines, Mexico, Spain, and the U.S.  The goal of each session varies, but ultimately we help advocates to gain a better understanding of what makes a successful and legitimate crowdlaw project, how common challenges may be anticipated and mitigated, and ideas for future discussions and collaborations around establishing meaningful best practices going forward.</p>
  background: >
    <p>Since 2014, GovLab has designed, hosted and moderated a series of online conferences to support the burgeoning network of crowdlaw leaders and practitioners from around the world.  Crowdlaw, or open, collaborative crowdsourced lawmaking, is a tech-enabled approach for drafting legislation or constitutions, that offers an alternative to the traditional method of policymaking, which typically occurs behind closed doors and with little input from the people it affects. </p>
    <p>The goal of these peer-to-peer learning events are to deepen the collective understanding of what works, what doesn’t, how to assess impact, and accelerate the implementation of more effective and legitimate participatory lawmaking practices. </p>

    <p>The goal of the CrowdLaw Conferences is to bring together practitioners and researchers of this emerging policy making field to learn from one another of what works, what doesn’t, what are the best practices and the challenges in the institutionalization of CrowdLaw. From the insights and learnings that come from these conferences we will create a framework to better understand the state of the field of crowdsourcing policy. We also will create a report with the findings of the conferences, a list of selected readings on the topic and twitter lists of the experts of the field, to give people the tools to understand more about using crowdsourcing in the process of policymaking. </p>

    <p>In an effort to safeguard the legitimacy and fairness of the grantmaking process, public funding agencies have traditionally done grantmaking behind closed doors. Whether to states or individuals, introducing greater openness at all stages of the grantmaking process has the potential to spur more creative problem-solving strategies and, ultimately, more effective outcomes because open processes enable greater diversity of expertise to be brought to bear.</p>

    <p>In collaboration with <a href="https://www.omidyar.com/" target="_blank">Omidyar Network</a>, the GovLab has conducted <strong>19 detailed case studies of open data projects around the world.</strong> The case studies were selected for their sectoral and geographic representativeness. They were built in part from secondary sources (“desk research”), but also from a number of first-hand interviews with important players and key stakeholders. The GovLab is currently undertaking an <a href="http://odimpact.org" target="_blank">open peer review</a> of the case studies and a key findings paper. Final versions will be published in the new year.</p>
  background: >
    <p>Recent years have witnessed considerable enthusiasm over open data. Several studies have documented its potential to spur economic innovation and social transformation, and to usher in fresh forms of political and government accountability. Yet for all the enthusiasm, we know little about how open data actually works, and what forms of impact it is really having.</p>
