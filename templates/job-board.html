            <h2>Mission & Vision</h2>
            <p>The Governance Lab at NYU Tandon School of Engineering (www.thegovlab.org) aims to improve our lives and communities by changing how we govern by using new technology.

            <p>The development team at the GovLab is a small but agile in-house team of experienced designers, product managers and software engineers who collaborate with GovLab leadership to design, create and build usable tools, platforms and products. As our name suggests, we are in the business of experimentation with new technology to strengthen democracy, and are looking for those who want to build open source software that is optimized for change. We believe in rough consensus, running code and co-creating products with our users through frequent iteration.</p>

                <li>Developing an online education platform to run high impact courses for civic innovators;</li>
                <li>Analyzing data flows in the criminal justice system to find opportunities for data sharing to decrease incarceration and crime.</li>
