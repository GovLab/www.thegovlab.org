        <h2>Who we are</h2>
        <p class="e-tagline">The GovLab’s mission is <br>"to improve people’s lives by changing the way we govern".</p>
        <p>Our goal is to strengthen the ability of institutions – including but not limited to governments – and people to work more openly, collaboratively, effectively and legitimately to make better decisions and solve public problems.</p>
        <p>We believe that increased availability and use of data, new ways to leverage the capacity, intelligence, and expertise of people in the problem-solving process, combined with new advances in technology and science can transform governance.</p>
        <p>We approach each challenge and opportunity in an interdisciplinary, collaborative way, irrespective of the problem, sector, geography and level of government.</p>
