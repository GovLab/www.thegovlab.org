                        <h3>Anirudh Dinesh</h3>
                        <h4>Research Fellow</h4>

                        <p>Anirudh Dinesh conducts research on governance innovation. He is a member of the team designing and piloting <a href="http://smartercrowdsourcing.org">experiments</a> for <a href="http://www.thegovlab.org/project-city-challenges.html">new models</a> of public engagement, what the GovLab calls people-led innovation, to improve the legitimacy and effectiveness of <a href="https://crowd.law">policy making</a> and solve urgent problems.</p> <p>In addition, Anirudh is a member of the CrowdLaw research team looking at how governments around the world are using technology to involve the public in legislative drafting and decision-making. He authored multiple case studies documenting how institutions are using online crowdsourcing methods to improve their lawmaking processes through better community engagement. He was also part of the team which produced the CrowdLaw for Congress playbook and website comprising in-depth case studies, lecture videos and interviews with politicians and congressional staff offering vivid detail of how and why their parliaments are turning to online engagement to improve lawmaking</p> <p>In his job, Anirudh also organizes events at the GovLab. He was part of the organizing team of the <a href="http://collectiveintelligenceconference.org">Collective Intelligence Conference</a> (June 2017). He has led multiple online coaching programs for the GovLab Academy, including the Open Seventeen Challenge and online and in-person workshops on problem definition.</p> <p> Anirudh is also a member of the Data Labs research team looking at how governments can create the infrastructure, including the necessary skills and governance rules, to facilitate the use of administrative data for evaluating and improving public programs. With a grant from Markets for Good, he collaborated with <a href="http://thinknpc.org">New Philanthropy Capital</a> in the UK to craft a series of <a href="https://medium.com/data-labs">case studies about Data Labs</a> and explore how they can enable charities as well as government to conduct more data-driven impact evaluations.</p> <p>In 2016, Anirudh helped to research, write and produce ten original <a href="http://www.smarterstate.org">Smarter State</a> case studies, focusing on how governments can use technology to leverage the skills of civil servants. He has also researched and authored reports on <a href="http://odimpact.org">Open Data for Developing Economies</a>, a project to explore the social and economic impact of opening government data.</p> <p>Whether in connection with events or research projects, Anirudh applies his background in computer science to help create high impact websites. He is a part of GovLab’s civic tech efforts and assists in the design and development of all of GovLab’s original tools and platforms.</p> <p>Prior to joining GovLab, Anirudh co-produced <a href="https://www.ted.com/tedx/events/14384">TEDxBNMIT 2015</a>, an independently organized TEDx event in Bangalore, India.</p> <p>Anirudh holds a master’s degree in Computer Engineering from New York University and an undergraduate degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from the Visvesvaraya Technological University in India. While studying there, he interned at the Defence Research and Development Organization, where he implemented the autonomous indoor navigation of a quadcopter.</p> <p>Anirudh is an avid blogger and his writings can be found at <a href="http://www.dudurudh.com">www.dudurudh.com</a>.</p>
