                <h3><a href="http://thegovlab.org/john-wilbanks-improving-informed-consent-through-design-to-advance-science/">Ideas Lunch Blog Post</a></h3>   <p>Persistent issues with data exchange and the confusion around portability of patient records are barriers to understanding the population’s health and health outcomes. While a comprehensive policy solution to portability of patient information and preferences about the use of their data is not likely in the near term, there are innovative non-policy strategies to address the problem that seek to put the patient at the center of the solution. At Sage Bionetworks, we have created an open source toolkit for creating “user interfaces” to informed consent documents for clinical studies, assisting in comprehension of the underlying legal text and allowing the creation of consent processes that work well with mobile devices and thew web. This talk will lay out the rationale for the toolkit, demonstrate its key components, and address emerging implementations for informed consent in different contexts.</p> <h3>About John</h3> <p>John Wilbanks is the Chief Commons Officer at Sage Bionetworks and a Senior Fellow at Faster Cures. He has worked at Harvard’s Berkman Center for Internet & Society, the World Wide Web Consortium, the US House of Representatives, and Creative Commons. John is a past affiliate of MIT’s Project on Mathematics and Computation and also started a bioinformatics company called Incellico, which is now part of Selventa. He advises the National Coordination Office’s NITRD program, sits on the Board of Directors for Impact Story and the TransMART Foundation, and sits on advisory boards for Boundless Learning, Curious, GenoSpace, and Patients Like Me. John holds a degree in Philosophy from Tulane and studied modern letters at the Sorbonne.</p>

                <h3>The Problem of Internet Radicalization?</h3> <p>The impending trial of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the alleged Boston Marathon bomber, has reignited debates concerning Internet radicalization: the role of digital and social media in galvanizing a few to carry out violent acts.  By bringing together detailed qualitative data of various case studies as well as aggregated statistics on homegrown terrorism, this talk explores questions at the intersection of digital media, security, rights and governance.  How is digital media positioned within the theories of radicalization that reverberate in the popular press, policy and policing?  What are the limits of these theories in isolating the effect of digital media in relation to a multitude of other factors?  How have theories of radicalization been operationalized in security, policing and punitive efforts and to what effect? How should – if at all – these theories inform approaches to Internet governance, particularly concerning the balance between constitutional and universal rights and security?</p> <h3>About Piotr</h3> <p>Piotr is the George Gerbner Postdoctoral Fellow at the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania.  He is currently completing a book manuscript entitled, Citizen, Terrorist, Double: Citizenship and Identity in the American War on Terror which examines the interconnection of media and official representations of homegrown terrorism, the increasing use of the “terrorism” paradigm to make sense of a variety of actors, actions and utterances, and the practices and experiences of citizenship in contemporary America.  Piotr earned a Dual-PhD from the University of Pennsylvania in communication and political science in 2014.  He also holds a B.A. in political science (University of Waterloo) and an advanced diploma in composition (Humber College).  He is also involved in an interdisciplinary project which examines the relation between how groups project, anticipate and imagine the future and how they collectively remember the past.</p>

                <h3>Measuring the Results of Public Investment in R&D Using Big Data</h3> <p>Investments in R&D have become an important policy lever for stimulating regional and national economic growth; competitiveness agendas routinely institute policies to support research. In the United States alone, R&D expenditures account for more than $150 billion a year and European nations have agreed to a target for R&D investment of at least 3% of GDP.  Yet investments at this scale beg obvious questions – why 3% of GDP rather than 2.9% or 3.1%?   Why is the public sector involved? What is the evidence, beyond anecdotes, that investments in science lead to innovation?  In sum, what are the returns to investment in research? Answering these questions has become an important policy issue in its own right; and the way in which the answers are measured is equally important  – what you measure is what you get.</p> <p>Evidence based answers have been difficult to find. Part of this is because outputs are manifold and the processes are complex. Part of it is that the appropriate data exist in multiple places and in a wide variety of formats. Part of it is that analytical approaches have been confused with reporting approaches.</p> <p>This seminar discusses the use of big data approaches to answer these important questions. It describes the conceptual and empirical framework used to trace the activities of researchers and their networks in the creation, adoption and transmission of ideas to the economic and scientific marketplace.</p> <h3>About Julia</h3> <p>Julia Lane is an Institute Fellow at the American Institutes for Research, professor of economics, BETA University of Strasbourg CNRS, Chercheur, Observatoire des Sciences et des Techniques, Paris, and professor, Melbourne Institute of Applied Economics and Social Research, University of Melbourne. She was formerly director of the National Science Foundation’s Science of Science and Innovation Policy program, senior vice president at NORC at the University of Chicago and senior research fellow at the U.S. Census Bureau.</p> <p>Dr. Lane has authored over 65 refereed articles and edited or authored seven books. She has been working with a number of national governments to document the results of their science investments. Her work has been featured in Science and Nature, and she has testified on the topic to both the U.S. Congress and the European Parliament. She is a coeditor, with the late Jack Marburger, of the Handbook of Science of Science Policy.</p>

                <h3>How Citizens Can Force Government To Change: Liberating Our Data (At Scale!)</h3> <p>When a government bureaucracy is not working the way you think it should be, what can you do to make it change? In this Ideas Lunch, Carl Malamud will discuss techniques and tactics his nonprofit organization uses to cajole large government agencies to change their ways. Three case studies will used to illustrate these principles.</p> <p>In the first half, we’ll look at the IRS Exempt Organizations database and how it is distributed, issues of privacy in the Form 990 reports made public by nonprofit organizations, and the question of e-file data. This will be followed by a brief discussion of the issue of edicts of government, the promulgation of the laws by which we as a people choose to govern ourselves.</p> <p>The second half of the session will be devoted to the PACER system, the electronic docketing system used by the U.S. federal courts. We’ll discuss the Yo.YourHonor.Org effort, a response to the Year-End report from the Chief Justice in which he discussed technology and the courts. A brief exercise in applied rhetoric will conclude this part of the Ideas Lunch.</p> <h3>About Carl</h3> <p>Considered one of the pioneers in getting government to face the challenges of the Internet in their own internal operations, Carl Malamud is the founder of Public.Resource.Org (“Public Resource”), a nonprofit organization that creates public works for a better government. Public Resource has helped put online 6,000 videos from the National Archives and other agencies, over 14,000 hours of video from the U.S. Congress, over 8 million Form 990 returns from the IRS, historical opinions of the U.S. Court of Appeals, docket materials from U.S. District Courts, and edicts of government (such as mandated public safety codes) at both the state and federal level. In many cases, these efforts have been accomplished over the strenuous objections of the government agencies who purportedly “own” the data.</p>

                <h3>Advancing Children’s Learning in a Digital Age</h3> <p>Michael Levine, Founding Executive Director of the Joan Ganz Cooney Center at Sesame Workshop, will be discussing his new book Tap, Click, Read: Growing Readers in a World of Screens. With Tap, Click Read, Lisa Guernsey of New America and Michael Levine tackle some of the most urgent concerns of the digital age: How do we encourage young children’s early literacy skills and promote a love of learning in the midst of a media landscape full of a dizzying array of games, videos, and apps? What will it take to create a future in which parents and teachers become adept at using media to build a foundation for children’s reading? Beyond traditional literacy, what are the digital competencies that today’s young children will need to master in an increasingly complex and interconnected world? The authors scan the marketplace of digital apps and games, and look at innovative models that use technology to encourage adult-child interactions to foster early literacy skills.</p> <h3>About Michael</h3> <p>Michael Levine is the Founding Executive Director of the Joan Ganz Cooney Center at Sesame Workshop.  The Center conducts research, develops prototypes, scalable models and design challenges, and convenes leaders to promote investments in high quality media experiences for children. Levine also serves in a senior executive position on Sesame Workshop’s leadership team, concentrating on public engagement and educational impact for the global non-profit.</p> <p>Prior to joining the Center, Michael served as Vice President for Asia Society, managing the global nonprofit’s interactive media and educational initiatives to promote knowledge and understanding of other world regions and cultures.  Michael previously oversaw Carnegie Corporation of New York’s groundbreaking work in early childhood development, educational media, and primary grades reform and was a senior advisor to the New York City Schools Chancellor, where he directed dropout prevention, afterschool, and early childhood initiatives.</p> <p>Dr. Levine serves on New York City’s Universal Pre-Kindergarten Scientific Advisory Council, and is a Pahara-Aspen Education Reform Fellow. He has been a frequent adviser to the White House and the U.S. Department of Education and writes for public affairs journals, including a regular column for Huffington Post.  He was named by Working Mother magazine as one of America’s most influential leaders in family and children’s policy and serves on several nonprofit boards, including Classroom, Inc., Forum for Youth Investment, We Are Family Foundation, DigiLearn, the Leman School, and Journeys in Film. Michael received his Ph.D. in Social Policy from Brandeis University’s Florence Heller School and his B.S. from Cornell University.</p>

                <p>The application of data-driven tools and technologies to address human rights issues is gaining traction. Collecting and analyzing data from various digital sources offers promising methods for monitoring or intervening in instances of abuse, exploitation, or victimization. Yet practitioners, researchers, and policymakers face unique challenges and opportunities when assessing technological benefit, risk, and harm. How can these technologies be used responsibly to assist people in need, prevent abuse, and protect from harm? A number of challenges and anxieties emerge around such questions – from surveillance and privacy to data biases and accountability. Addressing these concerns are crucial as data-driven techniques become the basis for decision making at the policy and operational levels. Using the case of big data and human trafficking as an example, this presentation will discuss the tensions that arise around data-driven interventions in human rights domains.</p>     <h3>About Mark</h3> <p>Mark Latonero a professor and researcher interested in technology and social change. Mark is interested in examining the risks and benefits of applying data-centric approaches to human rights and human security issues involving vulnerable populations. A primary area of investigation involves tech and data driven approaches to address human trafficking.</p> <p>Mark is a Fellow at the Data & Society Research Institute in New York as well as the research director at the Annenberg Center on Communication Leadership & Policy, and a research professor at the USC Annenberg School for Communication & Journalism. He completed his PhD at the USC Annenberg School and was a postdoctoral research scholar at the London School of Economics.</p>

                <p>Professor Samir Brahmachari’s lecture will focus on the use of open innovation, citizen science and crowdsourcing to accelerate and lower the cost of drug development to achieve “affordable healthcare for all.” He will tell the story of the Open Source Drug Discovery project (OSDD), which has been accelerating groundbreaking innovation in the design of new drugs for neglected tropical diseases like tuberculosis and malaria. Each day thousands of people die of TB around the world, and resistance to existing drugs has increased creating a major public health problem. No new safe TB drug has been developed in 50 years. Inspired by open source principles and making use of India’s computational strength, Dr. Brahmachari founded Open Source Drug Discovery to enable students, scientists, researchers, and individuals from all over the world to work collaboratively in a horizontal and decentralized manner, making contributions to the identification of novel drug targets to fight infectious diseases. He will talk about OSDD and its successful launch of a clinical trial of a new TB drug and discuss the learnings from this life-saving crowdsourcing project.</p> <h3>About Samir</h3> <p>Prof. Samir K. Brahmachari, J.C. Bose National Fellow, is currently also the Academy Professor of Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research and Chief Mentor of Open Source Drug Discovery. He served as the Director General of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), India – one of the largest chains of industrial R&D labs in the world for over six years (2007-2013). He is also the Founder Director of CSIR-Institute of Genomics & Integrative Biology (IGIB), Delhi (1997-2007) and has pioneered Functional Genomics research in India, successfully leading the Indian Genome Variation Project. This exploration of human genome variation in multi-ethnic, multilingual populations of India led to development of a national resource: the genetic profile of the people of India. Prof. Brahmachari has conceived and established the Open Source Drug Discovery (OSDD), a global collaborative translational research platform for affordable healthcare and a model for Science 2.0.His present interest lies in the utilization of genomics and computational technology to gain a systems level understanding of pathogenic organisms like Mycobacterium tuberculosis towards the development of low cost drugs and diagnostics to achieve the vision of affordable healthcare for all. Prof. Brahmachari mentors young students and is actively involved in promoting innovations through application oriented education and research.</p> <h3>Here are three papers about the Open Source Drug Discovery project</h3> <ul>
